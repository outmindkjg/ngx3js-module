<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * This class generates a Prefiltered, Mipmapped Radiance Environment Map (PMREM) from a cubeMap environment texture.
	 * This allows different levels of blur to be quickly accessed based on material roughness. It is packed into a special CubeUV format that allows us to perform custom interpolation so that we can support nonlinear formats such as RGBE.l Unlike a traditional mipmap chain, it only goes down to the LOD_MIN level (above), and then creates extra even e filtered 'mips' at the same LOD_MIN resolution, associated with higher roughness levels. In this way we maintain resolution to smoothly interpolate diffuse lighting while limiting sampling computation.
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<h3>[name]( [param:WebGLRenderer renderer] )</h3>
	 * This constructor creates a new [name].
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>[method:WebGLRenderTarget fromScene]( [param:Scene scene], [param:Number sigma], [param:Number near], [param:Number far] )</h3>
	 * @param scene - The given scene.
	 * @param sigma - Specifies a blur radius in radians to be applied to the scene before PMREM generation. Default is *0*.
	 * @param near - The near plane value. Default is *0.1*.
	 * @param far - The far plane value. Default is *100*.
	 * Generates a PMREM from a supplied Scene, which can be faster than using an image if networking bandwidth is low.
	 * Optional near and far planes ensure the scene is rendered in its entirety (the cubeCamera is placed at the origin).
<h3>[method:WebGLRenderTarget fromEquirectangular]( [param:Texture equirectangular] )</h3>
	 * @param equirectangular - The equirectangular texture.
	 * Generates a PMREM from an equirectangular texture, which can be either LDR (RGBFormat) or HDR (RGBEFormat).
	 * The ideal input image size is 1k (1024 x 512), as this matches best with the 256 x 256 cubemap output.
<h3>[method:WebGLRenderTarget fromCubemap]( [param:CubeTexture cubemap] )</h3>
	 * @param cubemap - The cubemap texture.
	 * Generates a PMREM from an cubemap texture, which can be either LDR (RGBFormat) or HDR (RGBEFormat).
	 * The ideal input cube size is 256 x 256, as this matches best with the 256 x 256 cubemap output.
<h3>[method:undefined compileCubemapShader]()</h3>
	 * Pre-compiles the cubemap shader. You can get faster start-up by invoking this method during your texture's network fetch for increased concurrency.
<h3>[method:undefined compileEquirectangularShader]()</h3>
	 * Pre-compiles the equirectangular shader. You can get faster start-up by invoking this method during your texture's network fetch for increased concurrency.
<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
	 * Disposes of the PMREMGenerator's internal memory. Note that PMREMGenerator is a static class, so you should not need more than one PMREMGenerator object. If you do, calling dispose() on one of them will cause any others to also become unusable.
