<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * Serves as a base class for the other shadow classes.
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<h3>[name]( [param:Camera camera] )</h3>
	 * @param camera - the light's view of the world.
	 * Create a new [name]. This is not intended to be called directly - it is used as a base class by other light shadows.
<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>[property:Boolean autoUpdate]</h3>
	 * Enables automatic updates of the light's shadow. Default is *true*.
	 * If you do not require dynamic lighting / shadows, you may set this to *false*.
<h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
	 * The light's view of the world. This is used to generate a depth map of the scene; objects behind other objects from the light's perspective will be in shadow.
<h3>[property:Float bias]</h3>
	 * Shadow map bias, how much to add or subtract from the normalized depth when deciding whether a surface is in shadow.
	 * The default is 0. Very tiny adjustments here (in the order of 0.0001) may help reduce artifacts in shadows <h3>[property:Integer blurSamples]</h3>
	 * The amount of samples to use when blurring a VSM shadow map.
<h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget map]</h3>
	 * The depth map generated using the internal camera; a location beyond a pixel's depth is in shadow. Computed internally during rendering.
<h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget mapPass]</h3>
	 * The distribution map generated using the internal camera; an occlusion is calculated based on the distribution of depths. Computed internally during rendering.
<h3>[property:Vector2 mapSize]</h3>
	 * A [Page:Vector2] defining the width and height of the shadow map.
	 * Higher values give better quality shadows at the cost of computation time. Values must be powers of 2, up to the [WebGLRenderer.capabilities](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.capabilities).maxTextureSize for a given device, although the width and height don't have to be the same (so, for example, (512, 1024) is valid).
	 * The default is *( 512, 512 )*.
<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrix]</h3>
	 * Model to shadow camera space, to compute location and depth in shadow map. Stored in a [Matrix4](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Matrix4). This is computed internally during rendering.
<h3>[property:Boolean needsUpdate]</h3>
	 * When set to *true*, shadow maps will be updated in the next *render* call. Default is *false*.
	 * If you have set *.autoUpdate* to *false*, you will need to set this property to *true* and then make a render call to update the light's shadow.
<h3>[property:Float normalBias]</h3>
	 * Defines how much the position used to query the shadow map is offset along the object normal.
	 * The default is 0. Increasing this value can be used to reduce shadow acne especially in large scenes where light shines onto geometry at a shallow angle. The cost is that shadows may appear distorted.
<h3>[property:Float radius]</h3>
	 * Setting this to values greater than 1 will blur the edges of the shadow.
	 * High values will cause unwanted banding effects in the shadows - a greater *.mapSize*
	 * will allow for a higher value to be used here before these effects become visible.
	 * If [WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type) is set to [PCFSoftShadowMap](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Renderer), radius has no effect and it is recommended to increase softness by decreasing *.mapSize* instead.
	 * Note that this has no effect if the [WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type) is set to [BasicShadowMap](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Renderer).
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>[method:Vector2 getFrameExtents]()</h3>
	 * Used internally by the renderer to extend the shadow map to contain all viewports <h3>[method:undefined updateMatrices]( [param:Light light] )</h3>
	 * Update the matrices for the camera and shadow, used internally by the renderer.
	 * @param ligh - the light for which the shadow is being rendered.
<h3>[method:Frustum getFrustum]()</h3>
	 * Gets the shadow cameras frustum. Used internally by the renderer to cull objects.
<h3>[method:number getViewportCount]()</h3>
	 * Used internally by the renderer to get the number of viewports that need to be rendered for this shadow.
<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
	 * Disposes of this shadow's textures ([map](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/LightShadow.map) and [mapPass](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/LightShadow.mapPass)).
<h3>[method:this copy]( [param:LightShadow source] )</h3>
	 * Copies value of all the properties from the [source](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/LightShadow) to this Light.
<h3>[method:LightShadow clone]()</h3>
	 * Creates a new LightShadow with the same properties as this one.
<h3>[method:Object toJSON]()</h3>
	 * Serialize this LightShadow.
