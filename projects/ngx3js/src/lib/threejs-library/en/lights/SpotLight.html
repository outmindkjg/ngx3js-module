	 * [Object3D](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D) &rarr; [Light](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light) &rarr;
<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * This light gets emitted from a single point in one direction, along a cone that increases in size the further from the light it gets. 
	 * This light can cast shadows - see the [SpotLightShadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/SpotLightShadow) page for details.
	 * ### Code Example
	 * ```javascript
	 * // white spotlight shining from the side, casting a shadow
	 * const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight( 0xffffff );
	 * spotLight.position.set( 100, 1000, 100 );
	 * spotLight.castShadow = true;
	 * spotLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
	 * spotLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;
	 * spotLight.shadow.camera.near = 500;
	 * spotLight.shadow.camera.far = 4000;
	 * spotLight.shadow.camera.fov = 30;
	 * scene.add( spotLight );
	 * ### Examples
	 * [lights / spotlight ](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_lights_spotlight)

<h2>Constructor</h2>
<h3>[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity], [param:Float distance], [param:Radians angle], [param:Float penumbra], [param:Float decay] )</h3>
	 * @param color - hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).
	 * @param intensity - numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.
	 * @param distance - Maximum range of the light. Default is 0 (no limit).
	 * @param angle - Maximum angle of light dispersion from its direction whose upper bound is Math.PI/2.
	 * @param penumbra - Percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to penumbra.
	 * Takes values between zero and 1. Default is zero.
	 * @param decay - The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.
	 * Creates a new [name].
<h2>Properties</h2>
	 * See the base [Light](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light) class for common properties.
<h3>[property:Float angle]</h3>
	 * Maximum extent of the spotlight, in radians, from its direction. Should be no more than *Math.PI/2*. The default is *Math.PI/3*.
<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
	 * If set to *true* light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [SpotLightShadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/SpotLightShadow) for details.
	 * The default is *false*.
<h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
	 * The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.
	 * In [physically correct](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights) mode, decay = 2 leads to physically realistic light falloff. The default is *1*.
<h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
<em>Default mode</em> - When distance is zero, light does not attenuate. When distance is non-zero, light will attenuate linearly from maximum intensity at the light's position down to zero at this distance from the light.
<em>[Physically correct](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights) mode</em> - When distance is zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law to infinite distance. When distance is non-zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square law until near the distance cutoff, where it will then attenuate quickly and smoothly to 0. Inherently, cutoffs are not physically correct.
	 * Default is *0.0*.
<h3>[property:Float intensity]</h3>
	 * The light's intensity. Default is *1*. 
	 * In [physically correct](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights) mode, intensity is the luminous intensity of the light measured in candela (cd).
	 * Changing the power will also change the light's intensity.
<h3>[property:Float penumbra]</h3>
	 * Percent of the spotlight cone that is attenuated due to penumbra. Takes values between zero and 1. The default is *0.0*.
<h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
	 * This is set equal to [Object3D.DefaultUp](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.DefaultUp) (0, 1, 0), so that the light shines from the top down.
<h3>[property:Float power]</h3>
	 * The light's power.
	 * In [physically correct](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights) mode, power is the luminous power of the light measured in lumens (lm). 
	 * Changing this will also change the light's intensity.
<h3>[property:SpotLightShadow shadow]</h3>
	 * A [SpotLightShadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/SpotLightShadow) used to calculate shadows for this light.
<h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
	 * The Spotlight points from its *.position* to target.position. The default position of the target is *(0, 0, 0)*.
	 * *Note*: For the target's position to be changed to anything other than the default, it must be added to the [scene](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Scene) using scene.add( light.target );
	 * This is so that the target's [matrixWorld](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.matrixWorld) gets automatically updated each frame.
	 * It is also possible to set the target to be another object in the scene (anything with a [position](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.position) property), like so:
	 * const targetObject = new THREE.Object3D();
	 * scene.add(targetObject);
	 * light.target = targetObject;
	 * The spotlight will now track the target object.
<h2>Methods</h2>
	 * See the base [Light](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light) class for common methods.
<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
	 * Override of base class's [dispose](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light.dispose).
	 * Disposes of this light's [shadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/SpotLightShadow).
<h3>[method:this copy]( [param:SpotLight source] )</h3>
	 * Copies value of all the properties from the [source](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/SpotLight) to this SpotLight.
	 * [src/[path](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/[path].js).js]
