	 * [Object3D](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D) &rarr; [Light](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light) &rarr;
<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * A light that gets emitted in a specific direction. This light will behave as though it is infinitely far away and the rays produced from it are all parallel. The common use case for this is to simulate daylight; the sun is far enough away that its position can be considered to be infinite, and all light rays coming from it are parallel.
	 * This light can cast shadows - see the [DirectionalLightShadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/DirectionalLightShadow) page for details.
<h2>A Note about Position, Target and rotation</h2>
	 * A common point of confusion for directional lights is that setting the rotation has no effect.
	 * This is because three.js's DirectionalLight is the equivalent to what is often called a 'Target Direct Light' in other applications.
	 * This means that its direction is calculated as pointing from the light's [position](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.position) to	the *.target*'s position (as opposed to a 'Free Direct Light' that just has a rotation component).
	 * The reason for this is to allow the light to cast shadows - the *.shadow*
	 * camera needs a position to calculate shadows from.
	 * See the *.target* property below for details on updating the target.
	 * ### Code Example
	 * ```javascript
	 * // White directional light at half intensity shining from the top.
	 * const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 0.5 );
	 * scene.add( directionalLight );
 * ### Examples
	 * [controls / fly ](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/misc_controls_fly)
	 * [effects / parallaxbarrier ](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_effects_parallaxbarrier)
	 * [effects / stereo ](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_effects_stereo)
	 * [geometry / extrude / splines ](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_geometry_extrude_splines)
	 * [materials / bumpmap ](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_materials_bumpmap)
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<h3>[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity] )</h3>
	 * @param color - hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).
	 * @param intensity - numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.
	 * Creates a new [name].
<h2>Properties</h2>
	 * See the base [Light](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light) class for common properties.
<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
	 * If set to *true* light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [DirectionalLightShadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/DirectionalLightShadow) for details.
	 * The default is *false*.
<h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
	 * This is set equal to [Object3D.DefaultUp](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.DefaultUp) (0, 1, 0), so that the light shines from the top down.
<h3>[property:DirectionalLightShadow shadow]</h3>
	 * A [DirectionalLightShadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/DirectionalLightShadow) used to calculate shadows for this light.
<h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
	 * The DirectionalLight points from its *.position* to target.position. The default position of the target is *(0, 0, 0)*.
*Note*: For the target's position to be changed to anything other than the default, it must be added to the [scene](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Scene) using scene.add( light.target );
	 * This is so that the target's [matrixWorld](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.matrixWorld) gets automatically updated each frame.
	 * It is also possible to set the target to be another object in the scene (anything with a [position](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.position) property), like so:
	 * const targetObject = new THREE.Object3D();
	 * scene.add(targetObject);
	 * light.target = targetObject;
	 * The directionalLight will now track the target object.
<h2>Methods</h2>
	 * See the base [Light](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light) class for common methods.
<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
	 * Override of base class's [dispose](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Light.dispose).
	 * Disposes of this light's [shadow](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/DirectionalLightShadow).
<h3>[method:this copy]( [param:DirectionalLight source] )</h3>
	 * Copies value of all the properties from the [source](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/DirectionalLight) to this DirectionalLight.
