<h1>[name]</h1>

	 * A representation of mesh, line, or point geometry. Includes vertex positions, face indices, normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers, reducing the cost of passing all this data to the GPU.
	 * To read and edit data in BufferGeometry attributes, see [BufferAttribute](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/BufferAttribute) documentation.

<h2>Code Example</h2>

	 * const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
	 * //  create a simple square shape. We duplicate the top left and bottom right // vertices because each vertex needs to appear once per triangle.
	 * const vertices = new Float32Array( [
-1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
 1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
 1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
 1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
-1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
-1.0, -1.0,  1.0
] );
	 * //  itemSize = 3 because there are 3 values (components) per vertex geometry.setAttribute( 'position', new THREE.BufferAttribute( vertices, 3 ) );
	 * const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
	 * const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

<h2>Constructor</h2>

<h3>[name]()</h3>
<div>
	 * This creates a new [name]. It also sets several properties to a default value.
</div>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>[property:Object attributes]</h3>
	 * This hashmap has as id the name of the attribute to be set and as value the [buffer](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/BufferAttribute) to set it to.
	 * Rather than accessing this property directly, use *.setAttribute* and *.getAttribute* to access attributes of this geometry.

<h3>[property:Box3 boundingBox]</h3>
	 * Bounding box for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with *.computeBoundingBox*(). Default is *null*.

<h3>[property:Sphere boundingSphere]</h3>
	 * Bounding sphere for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with *.computeBoundingSphere*(). Default is *null*.

<h3>[property:Object drawRange]</h3>
	 * Determines the part of the geometry to render. This should not be set directly, instead use *.setDrawRange*. Default is { start: 0, count: Infinity }
	 * For non-indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of vertices to render.
	 * For indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of indices to render.

<h3>[property:Array groups]</h3>
	 * Split the geometry into groups, each of which will be rendered in a separate WebGL draw call.
	 * This allows an array of materials to be used with the bufferGeometry.
	 * Each group is an object of the form:
{ start: Integer, count: Integer, materialIndex: Integer }
	 * where start specifies the first element in this draw call â€“ the first vertex for non-indexed geometry, otherwise the first triangle index. Count specifies how many vertices (or indices) are included, and materialIndex specifies the material array index to use.
	 * Use *.addGroup* to add groups, rather than modifying this array directly.

<!-- Note: groups used to be called drawCalls <h3>[property:Array drawcalls]</h3>
	 * For geometries that use indexed triangles, this Array can be used to split the object into multiple WebGL draw calls. Each draw call will draw some subset of the vertices in this geometry using the configured [shader](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Material). This may be necessary if, for instance, you have more than 65535 vertices in your object.
 -->

<h3>[property:Integer id]</h3>
	 * Unique number for this bufferGeometry instance.
<h3>[property:BufferAttribute index]</h3>
	 * Allows for vertices to be re-used across multiple triangles; this is called using "indexed triangles".
	 * Each triangle is associated with the indices of three vertices. This attribute therefore stores the index of each vertex for each triangular face.
	 * If this attribute is not set, the [renderer](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/WebGLRenderer) assumes that each three contiguous positions represent a single triangle.
	 * Default is *null*.

<h3>[property:Object morphAttributes]</h3>
	 * Hashmap of [BufferAttribute](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/BufferAttribute)s holding details of the geometry's morph targets.

<h3>[property:Boolean morphTargetsRelative]</h3>
	 * Used to control the morph target behavior; when set to true, the morph target data is treated as relative offsets, rather than as absolute positions/normals.
	 * Default is *false*.

<h3>[property:String name]</h3>
	 * Optional name for this bufferGeometry instance. Default is an empty string.

<h3>[property:Object userData]</h3>
	 * An object that can be used to store custom data about the BufferGeometry. It should not hold references to functions as these will not be cloned.

<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
	 * [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) of this object instance.
	 * This gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>[method:this setAttribute]( [param:String name], [param:BufferAttribute attribute] )</h3>
