<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * This class is designed to assist with [raycasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting).
	 * Raycasting is used for mouse picking (working out what objects in the 3d space the mouse is over) amongst other things.
	 * ### Code Example
	 * ```javascript
	 * const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
	 * const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
	 * function onMouseMove( event ) {
	 * // calculate mouse position in normalized device coordinates // (-1 to +1) for both components mouse.x = ( event.clientX / window.innerWidth )  * @param 2 -1;
	 * mouse.y = - ( event.clientY / window.innerHeight ) * 2 + 1;
	 * }
	 * function render() {
	 * // update the picking ray with the camera and mouse position raycaster.setFromCamera( mouse, camera );
	 * // calculate objects intersecting the picking ray
	 * const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects( scene.children );
	 * for ( let i = 0; i < intersects.length; i ++ ) {
	intersects[ i ].object.material.color.set( 0xff0000 );
	 * }
	 * renderer.render( scene, camera );
	 * }
	 * window.addEventListener( 'mousemove', onMouseMove, false );
	 * window.requestAnimationFrame(render);

<h2>Constructor</h2>
<h3>[name]( [param:Vector3 origin], [param:Vector3 direction], [param:Float near], [param:Float far] )</h3>
	 * @param origin - The origin vector where the ray casts from.
	 * @param direction - The direction vector that gives direction to the ray. Should be normalized.
	 * @param near - All results returned are further away than near. Near can't be negative. Default value is 0.
	 * @param far - All results returned are closer than far. Far can't be lower than near. Default value is Infinity.
	 * This creates a new raycaster object.
<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>[property:Float far]</h3>
	 * The far factor of the raycaster. This value indicates which objects can be discarded based on the distance.
	 * This value shouldn't be negative and should be larger than the near property.
<h3>[property:Float near]</h3>
	 * The near factor of the raycaster. This value indicates which objects can be discarded based on the distance.
	 * This value shouldn't be negative and should be smaller than the far property.
<h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
	 * The camera to use when raycasting against view-dependent objects such as billboarded objects like [Sprites](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Sprites). This field can be set manually or is set when calling "setFromCamera".
	 * Defaults to null.
<h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
	 * Used by [name] to selectively ignore 3D objects when performing intersection tests. The following code example ensures that only 3D objects on layer *1* will be honored by the instance of [name].
	 * raycaster.layers.set( 1 );
	 * object.layers.enable( 1 );
<h3>[property:Object params]</h3>
	 * An object with the following properties:
{
	Mesh: {},
	Line: { threshold: 1 },
	LOD: {},
	Points: { threshold: 1 },
	Sprite: {}
	 * }
	 * Where threshold is the precision of the raycaster when intersecting objects, in world units.
<h3>[property:Ray ray]</h3>
	 * The [Page:Ray] used for the raycasting.
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>[method:undefined set]( [param:Vector3 origin], [param:Vector3 direction] )</h3>
	 * @param origin - The origin vector where the ray casts from.
	 * @param direction - The normalized direction vector that gives direction to the ray.
	 * Updates the ray with a new origin and direction. Please note that this method only copies the values from the arguments.
<h3>[method:undefined setFromCamera]( [param:Vector2 coords], [param:Camera camera] )</h3>
	 * @param coords - 2D coordinates of the mouse, in normalized device coordinates (NDC)---X and Y components should be between -1 and 1.
	 * @param camera - camera from which the ray should originate Updates the ray with a new origin and direction.
<h3>[method:Array intersectObject]( [param:Object3D object], [param:Boolean recursive], [param:Array optionalTarget] )</h3>
	 * @param object - The object to check for intersection with the ray.
	 * @param recursive - If true, it also checks all descendants. Otherwise it only checks intersection with the object. Default is true.
	 * @param optionalTarget - target to set the result. Otherwise a new [Array](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Array) is instantiated. If set, you must clear this array prior to each call (i.e., array.length = 0;).
	 * Checks all intersection between the ray and the object with or without the descendants. Intersections are returned sorted by distance, closest first. An array of intersections is returned...
	[ { distance, point, face, faceIndex, object }, ... ]
	 * @param distance - Second set of U,V coordinates at point of intersection [instanceId](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Integer) â€“ The index number of the instance where the ray intersects the InstancedMesh *Raycaster* delegates to the [raycast](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Object3D.raycast) method of the passed object, when evaluating whether the ray intersects the object or not. This allows [meshes](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Mesh) to respond differently to ray casting than [lines](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Line) and [pointclouds](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Points).
*Note* that for meshes, faces must be pointed towards the origin of the *.ray* in order to be detected; intersections of the ray passing through the back of a face will not be detected. To raycast against both faces of an object, you'll want to set the [material](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Mesh.material)'s [side](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Material.side) property to *THREE.DoubleSide*.
<h3>[method:Array intersectObjects]( [param:Array objects], [param:Boolean recursive], [param:Array optionalTarget] )</h3>
	 * @param objects - The objects to check for intersection with the ray.
	 * @param recursive - If true, it also checks all descendants of the objects. Otherwise it only checks intersection with the objects. Default is true.
	 * @param optionalTarget - target to set the result. Otherwise a new [Array](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Array) is instantiated. If set, you must clear this array prior to each call (i.e., array.length = 0;).
	 * Checks all intersection between the ray and the objects with or without the descendants. Intersections are returned sorted by distance, closest first. Intersections are of the same form as those returned by *.intersectObject*.
