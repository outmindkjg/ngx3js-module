<h1>Texture Constants</h1>
<h2>Mapping Modes</h2>
	 * THREE.UVMapping THREE.CubeReflectionMapping THREE.CubeRefractionMapping THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping THREE.EquirectangularRefractionMapping THREE.CubeUVReflectionMapping THREE.CubeUVRefractionMapping 
	 * These define the texture's mapping mode.
	 * [UVMapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Constant) is the default, and maps the texture using the mesh's UV coordinates.
	 * The rest define environment mapping types.
	 * [CubeReflectionMapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Constant) and [CubeRefractionMapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Constant) are for use with a [CubeTexture](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/CubeTexture), which is made up of six textures, one for each face of the cube.
	 * [CubeReflectionMapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Constant) is the default for a [CubeTexture](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/CubeTexture). 
	 * [EquirectangularReflectionMapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Constant) and [EquirectangularRefractionMapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Constant)
	 * are for use with an equirectangular environment map.  Also called a lat-long map, an equirectangular texture represents a 360-degree view along the horizontal centerline, and a 180-degree view along the vertical axis, with the top and bottom edges of the image corresponding to the north and south poles of a mapped sphere.
	 * See the [materials / envmaps](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_materials_envmaps) example.
<h2>Wrapping Modes</h2>
	 * THREE.RepeatWrapping THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping 
	 * These define the texture's [wrapS](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.wrapS) and [wrapT](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.wrapT) properties, which define horizontal and vertical texture wrapping.
	 * With [RepeatWrapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) the texture will simply repeat to infinity.
	 * [ClampToEdgeWrapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) is the default.
	 * The last pixel of the texture stretches to the edge of the mesh.
	 * With [MirroredRepeatWrapping](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) the texture will repeats to infinity, mirroring on each repeat.
<h2>Magnification Filters</h2>
	 * THREE.NearestFilter THREE.LinearFilter 
	 * For use with a texture's [magFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.magFilter)	property, these define the texture magnification function to be used when the pixel being textured maps to an area less than or equal to one texture element (texel).
	 * [NearestFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.
	 * [LinearFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) is the default and returns the weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest to the specified texture coordinates, and can include items wrapped or repeated from other parts of a texture, depending on the values of [wrapS](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.wrapS) and [wrapT](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.wrapT), and on the exact mapping.
<h2>Minification Filters</h2>
	 * THREE.NearestFilter THREE.NearestMipmapNearestFilter THREE.NearestMipmapLinearFilter THREE.LinearFilter THREE.LinearMipmapNearestFilter THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter 
	 * For use with a texture's [minFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.minFilter)	property, these define the texture minifying function that is used whenever the pixel being textured maps to an area greater than one texture element (texel).

	 * [NearestMipmapNearestFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel being textured and uses the [NearestFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) criterion (the texel nearest to the center of the pixel) to produce a texture value.
	 * [NearestMipmapLinearFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel being textured and uses the [NearestFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) criterion to produce a texture value from each mipmap. The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values.
	 * [LinearMipmapNearestFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel being textured and uses the [LinearFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) criterion (a weighted average of the four texels that are closest to the center of the pixel)
	 * to produce a texture value.
	 * [LinearMipmapLinearFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) is the default and chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel being textured and uses the [LinearFilter](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) criterion to produce a texture value from each mipmap. The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values.
	 * See the [materials / texture / filters](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/examples/webgl_materials_texture_filters) example.

	 * [AlphaFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) discards the red, green and blue components and reads just the alpha component.
	 * [RedFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) discards the green and blue components and reads just the red component.
	 * [RedIntegerFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) discards the green and blue components and reads just the red component.
	 * The texels are read as integers instead of floating point.
	 * (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering context).
	 * [RGFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) discards the alpha, and blue components and reads the red, and green components.
	 * (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering context).

	 * (can only be used with a WebGL 2 rendering context).
	 * [LuminanceFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) reads each element as a single luminance component.
 This is then converted to a floating point, clamped to the range [0,1], and then assembled  into an RGBA element by placing the luminance value in the red, green and blue channels,
 and attaching 1.0 to the alpha channel.
	 * [LuminanceAlphaFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) reads each element as a luminance/alpha double.
	 * The same process occurs as for the [LuminanceFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant), except that the alpha channel may have values other than *1.0*.
	 * [RGBEFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) is identical to [RGBAFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant).
	 * [DepthFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) reads each element as a single depth value, converts it to floating point, and clamps to the range [0,1].
	 * This is the default for [DepthTexture](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/DepthTexture).
	 * [DepthStencilFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) reads each element is a pair of depth and stencil values.
	 * The depth component of the pair is interpreted as in [DepthFormat](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant).
	 * The stencil component is interpreted based on the depth + stencil internal format.
	 * Note that the texture must have the correct [type](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.type) set, as described above.
	 * See [WebGLRenderingContext.texImage2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/texImage2D) for details.

	 * and [type](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.type).
	 * For more in-depth information regarding internal formats, you can also refer directly to the [WebGL2 Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/) and to the [OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/es_spec_3.0.pdf).
<h2>Encoding</h2>
	 * THREE.LinearEncoding THREE.sRGBEncoding THREE.GammaEncoding THREE.RGBEEncoding THREE.RGBDEncoding THREE.BasicDepthPacking THREE.RGBADepthPacking 
	 * For use with a Texture's [encoding](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture.encoding)	property.
	 * If the encoding type is changed after the texture has already been used by a material, you will need to set [Material.needsUpdate](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Material.needsUpdate) to *true* to make the material recompile.
	 * [LinearEncoding](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/constant) is the default.
	 * Values other than this are only valid for a material's map, envMap and emissiveMap.
