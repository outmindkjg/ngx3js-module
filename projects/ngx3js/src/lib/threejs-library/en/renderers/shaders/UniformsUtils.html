<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * Provides utility functions for managing uniforms.
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>[method:Object clone]( [param:Object src] )</h3>
	 * @param sr - An object representing uniform definitions.
	 * Clones the given uniform definitions by performing a deep-copy. That means if the [value](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Uniform.value) of a uniform refers to an object like a [Vector3](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Vector3)
	 * or [Texture](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/Texture), the cloned uniform will refer to a new object reference.
<h3>[method:Object merge]( [param:Array uniforms] )</h3>
	 * @param uniform - An array of objects containing uniform definitions.
	 * Merges the given uniform definitions into a single object. Since the method internally uses *.clone*(), it performs a deep-copy when producing the merged uniform definitions.
