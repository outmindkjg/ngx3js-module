<h1>[name]</h1>
	 * A group of objects that receives a shared animation state.
	 * For an overview of the different elements of the three.js animation system see the "Animation System" article in the "Next Steps" section of the manual.
<h2>Usage:</h2>
	 * Add objects you would otherwise pass as 'root' to the constructor or the [clipAction](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/AnimationMixer.clipAction)
	 * method of [AnimationMixer](https://outmindkjg.github.io/ngx3js-doc/#/docs/ngxapi/en/AnimationMixer) and instead pass this object as 'root'.
	 * Note that objects of this class appear as one object to the mixer, so cache control of the individual objects must be done	on the group.
<h2>Limitations</h2>
	 * The animated properties must be compatible among all objects in the group.
	 * A single property can either be controlled through a target group or directly, but not both.
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<h3>[name]( [param:Object obj1], [param:Object obj2], [param:Object obj3], ... )</h3>
	 * @param obj - an abitrary number of meshes that share the same animation state.
<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>[property:Object stats]</h3>
	 * An object that contains some informations of this *AnimationObjectGroup* (total number, number in use, number of bindings per object)
<h3>[property:String uuid]</h3>
	 * The [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) of this *AnimationObjectGroup*. It gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>[method:undefined add]( [param:Object obj1], [param:Object obj2], [param:Object obj3], ... )</h3>
	 * Adds an arbitrary number of objects to this *AnimationObjectGroup*.
<h3>[method:undefined remove]( [param:Object obj1], [param:Object obj2], [param:Object obj3], ... )</h3>
	 * Removes an arbitrary number of objects from this *AnimationObjectGroup*.
<h3>[method:undefined uncache]( [param:Object obj1], [param:Object obj2], [param:Object obj3], ... )</h3>
	 * Deallocates all memory resources for the passed objects of this *AnimationObjectGroup*.
